# impact-evaluation-2025-public
This respository contains the RMarkdown code and HTML outputs of RMarkdown code used to estimate the key figures used in GWWC's 2023â€“2024 Impact Evaluation. This code requires connection to GWWC's database to run and so cannot be run by users outside of GWWC. It does, however provide a record of how the majority of the analysis was conducted for this impact evaluation. While we conducted some interpretation of results while writing these scripts, the discussion in these scripts should be considered our rough notes rather than our final conclusions on any given result. Our current (at the time of writing this impact evaluation) interpretation of the critical results can be found in our final report.

## Folders

There are 3 key folders in this repository:

- Surveys: Containing the scripts used to clean and analyse (most of) the surveys that were conducted as part of this impact evaluation. These are where we calculate most of our recording and counterfactuality coefficients. The survey subfolders contain the scripts used to clean and analyse the data associated with a specific survey.
- Analysis: Containing the scripts used to estimate most of the key inputs to the impact evaluation that were not derived from surveys.
- Quick checks: Containing scripts used to perform quick analyses conducted during the writeup of the impact evaluation.
